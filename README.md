# kinesis-firehose-addon

The `kinesis-firehose-addon` module adds AWS Kinesis Firehose access to a Sym runtime connector module.

This `Addon` will add a policy to the role generated by a `Connector`.

You typically include this `Addon` by adding `aws/kinesis-firehose` to the  `addons` property of the runtime connector module, rather than referring to the policy ARN itself.

Kinesis Firehoses must be tagged with `${var.tag_name}=${var.environment}` in order to be accessible by this addon.

```hcl
module "runtime_connector" {
  source  = "symopsio/runtime-connector/sym"
  version = ">= 1.0.0"

  addons      = ["aws/kinesis-firehose"]
  environment = "sandbox"
}
```
